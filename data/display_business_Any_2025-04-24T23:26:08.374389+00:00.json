        "scrap_content": "- SHIB’s burn rate spike and address growth hint at renewed user-driven momentum.\n- Shiba Inu’s Exchange Inflows and long liquidations expose risk despite bullish technical formation.\nShiba Inu [SHIB] recorded a staggering 1,361% surge in its 24-hour token burn rate, injecting renewed energy into the SHIB community.\nAt press time, the token traded at $0.00001309, reflecting a 3.95% drop over the last 24 hours. But, price isn’t always the first to react.\nWhile the price remains subdued, underlying on-chain metrics are showing promising signs of revitalized network activity. Recent address statistics reveal a significant uptick in user engagement.\nNew Addresses grew by 22.10% over the past seven days, while active addresses rose by 23.07%.\nEven zero-balance addresses, often linked to inactive or reset wallets, spiked by 31.41%. This pattern suggests both fresh inflows and renewed activity from dormant users.\nHistorically, such increases have served as precursors to price volatility.\nHowever, whether this leads to a sustained rally depends on broader market participation and follow-through from whales and institutional players.\nFor now, the organic user growth presents a strong foundational signal.\nBullish cup and handle forms: Can SHIB break resistance?\nOn the technical chart, SHIB appears to be completing a bullish cup and handle formation.\nThe neckline resistance stands at $0.00001411. A confirmed breakout above this level could propel the token toward the projected target at $0.00001709.\nHowever, there’s a crucial support zone near $0.00001051. Losing this level would invalidate the pattern and potentially open doors to further downside.\nWith the price consolidating near the neckline, the next few sessions will be critical in determining whether SHIB can maintain bullish momentum or face renewed selling pressure.\nIs the memecoin’s market setup bullish or overextended?\nOf course, this alone doesn’t paint the full picture.\nExchange reserves declined slightly by 0.12% over the last seven days, suggesting reduced selling pressure. This often signals accumulation by long-term holders.\nYet, the 24-hour Netflow plunged by 157.97%, showing that traders recently rushed to deposit SHIB—often a sign of intent to sell.\nMeanwhile, liquidation data reveal a heavily bullish bias.\nAt press time, long liquidations totaled $499K, compared to just $12K in shorts. This lopsided leverage often signals frothy optimism—where any failed breakout may trigger a swift shakeout.\nCan Shiba Inu maintain its upward momentum?\nDespite the 24-hour price dip, SHIB’s spike in burn rate and address activity reflect positive on-chain sentiment. However, exchange and derivatives data expose potential risks tied to over-leveraged optimism.\nFor SHIB to truly reverse its downtrend, it must break $0.00001411 with strong volume and sustained inflows. Until then, cautious optimism—not FOMO—may be the smarter play.",

        "scrap_content": "A Pierre Poilievre-led government would maintain all existing government agreements for the auto sector, the Conservative leader said Thursday.\n“We will honour all agreements for the auto sector that the government has made, but we will not force Canadians to pay a $20,000 tax on automobiles,” Poilievre said at a news conference in Halifax.\n“We will continue to support the battery plants, the EVs and the other commitments the government has made, because we don’t believe in tearing up agreements.”\nThe Parliamentary Budget Officer estimated in 2024 that federal support for electric vehicle investment in Canada totalled as much as $31.4 billion, while provincial support was up to $21.1 billion.\nBut the “$20,000 tax” Poilievre referred to — the focus of his announcement on Thursday — is tied to former prime minister Justin Trudeau’s target that zero-emission vehicles should make up 20 per cent of new car sales starting in 2026, growing to 100 per cent by 2035.\nThe Conservative leader has now renamed part of the policy the “Car(ney) tax,” in reference to Liberal Leader Mark Carney.\nPoilievre has claimed that if automakers don’t meet those quotas, they may be fined up to $20,000 for every vehicle they fall short of that target total — in other words, car manufacturers who sell gas-powered vehicles exceeding the “Liberal quota” will be slapped with a “$20,000 tax” per vehicle.\n“I think they’re trying to say not selling enough EVs is the same as selling too many gas cars. And so they’re kind of simultaneously saying not enough EVs is a $20,000 fine, and too many gas cars is a $20,000 tax,” said Joanna Kyriazis, the director of public affairs at Clean Energy Canada.\nBut neither of those claims are accurate, Kyriazis said.\nWhile both B.C. and Quebec have zero-emission vehicle mandates that come with a $20,000 penalty per vehicle that misses the quota, the federal regulations are different.\n“Under the federal EV availability standard, there are no monetary penalties for non-compliance,” Kyriazis said.\n“The $20,000 that they’re referring to is a compliance pathway where if a carmaker cannot meet its requirements in a given year based on how many EVs it makes available for sale in Canada, that carmaker can instead choose to invest in charging infrastructure to earn credits instead,” she said. “And for every $20,000 invested in charging infrastructure, a carmaker can earn one credit. So it’s not a penalty, it’s a compliance flexibility.”\nPoilievre’s suggestion, therefore, that an automaker selling too many gas-powered cars will get hit with a $20,000 “tax” is misleading, Kyriazis said.\nShe said that aside from investing in charging infrastructure for electric vehicles, manufacturers can also purchase credits from other automakers — something Poilievre has argued will benefit foreign carmakers like Tesla.\nThere are also grace periods, Kyriazis said, “where if an automaker doesn’t comply in a given year, they have a couple more years to make it up and earn and sell more EVs in future years.”\n“There’s a lot of wiggle room in any given year,” she said.\n“If they can’t earn enough credits in a given year using any of those compliance pathways, then they are at risk of federal prosecution.”\nThe Conservatives have pointed to research that indicates that the mandate will lead to job losses in the auto sector, and on Thursday highlighted an endorsement from Brian Kingston, the head of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers’ Association, who said that “mandating EV sales when the auto industry is under attack from U.S. tariffs is putting the puck in our own net.”\nNevertheless, Poilievre said in Halifax he had “nothing against electric cars.”\n“If you want one, buy one. Free choice. Make your own decision. I encourage you to buy one that’s made in Canada.”\nIn their campaign platform released Tuesday, the Conservatives said they would generate $11.2 billion in revenue over four years from cancelling the mandate.\nKyraizis said her interpretation of that figure is that the Conservatives believe scrapping the policy will lead to economic growth in Canada’s auto sector, generating billions in revenue and associated tax revenue for the government.\n“But I just want to point to (how) Canada’s auto sector started winning when the EV transition started becoming real,” Kyriazis said.\n“If we are removing policies that are supportive of the EV transition, that’s a bad news story for our auto sector, not a good news story.”\nWith files from Alex Ballingall\nThe Conservatives’ costed platform, dropped Tuesday, reveals a new pledge to “ban new or higher",

These actions ensure the Board's expectations remain aligned with evolving risks and further support innovation in the banking system.\nThe Board is rescinding its 2022 supervisory letter establishing an expectation that state member banks provide advance notification of planned or current crypto-asset activities. As a result, the Board will no longer expect banks to provide notification and will instead monitor banks' crypto-asset activities through the normal supervisory process.\nThe Board is also rescinding its 2023 supervisory letter regarding the supervisory nonobjection process for state member bank engagement in dollar token activities.\nFinally, the Board, together with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is joining the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in withdrawing from two 2023 statements jointly issued by the federal bank regulatory agencies regarding banks' crypto-asset activities and exposures. The Board will work with the agencies to consider whether additional guidance to support innovation, including crypto-asset activities, is appropriate.\nFor media inquiries, please email [email protected] or call 202-452-2955.",

But he didn’t wait until the call to announce major changes at Intel, nor did he begin his reign by laying off 20 percent of the company’s employees, as Bloomberg reported he might.\n“We have not set any headcount reduction target,” Intel spokesperson Sophie Metzger tells The Verge.\nInstead, Tan is announcing that employees will return to the office for an additional day per week — four days in office, up from three — as the company purges what he characterizes as “unnecessary bureaucracy,” reduces the size of teams, and cuts back on “time-consuming corporate administrative tasks such as non-essential training and documentation.”\nIntel has just published an all-hands memo from Tan to employees detailing these and other changes; you can read it in full at the bottom of this post. The company is also subtly suggesting that job cuts are nigh, but that they might come from Intel’s individual leaders rather than layoffs from the company as a whole.\n“We have learned some valuable lessons from past actions. We must balance our reductions with the need to retain and recruit key talent. I will empower each of my leaders to make the best possible decisions aligned with our top priorities,” Tan writes in the memo.\nBut it sounds like there will be pressure on those leaders to cut people, and soon:\nI’ve been surprised to learn that, in recent years, the most important KPI for many managers at Intel has been the size of their teams. Going forward, this will not be the case. I’m a big believer in the philosophy that the best leaders get the most done with the fewest people.\nTan says that these workforce reductions will “begin in Q2” — which is now — “and we will move as quickly as possible over the next several months.”\nIntel said today it that it hopes to save an extra $0.5 billion in 2025 alone compared to previous goals, and more in 2026. As for this quarter, the company lost $0.4 billion in Q1 2025, on flat revenue of $12.7 billion.\nReuters reported last month that Tan planned to significantly change Intel’s chip manufacturing and cut “what Tan views as a slow-moving and bloated middle management layer.” That report seems to have been accurate. On the earnings call, Tan says he’s also instructed teams to find $2 billion they can save in capital expenditures.\nIn his first public statement in March, Tan said that his Intel would be “an engineering-focused company” that would “take calculated risks to disrupt and leapfrog” in the future. Today, he says he’s doing that in part by flattening the organization: “All critical product and manufacturing and G&A functions that were spread over 2-3 layers are now directly reporting to me,” he says on the earnings call.\n“Organizational complexity and bureaucracies have been suffocating the innovation and agility we need to win. It takes too long for decisions to get made. New ideas and people who generate them have not been given the room or resources to incubate and grow. The unnecessary silos have led to bad execution. I’m here to fix this,” says Tan.\nAs for Tan’s strategy for Intel overall, he says “it’s a bit too soon for me to provide all the details” but shared several priorities, including:\n- “Start building best-in-class products again”\n- “A holistic approach to redefine our portfolio to optimize our products for new and emerging AI workloads”\n- “Refine our AI strategy with a focus on emerging areas of interest”\n- “Our goal will be to enable the next wave of computing defined by reasoning models, agentic AI, and physical AI”\n- “We need to build trust with foundry customers”\n- “Learn to delight our customers by building wafers that meet their required power, performance area, and on-time schedule”\n- “Our business is capital intensive and we have important investment to make at the time when our financial performance is not where it needs to be. This means we need to be prudent with capital.”\nMeanwhile, Intel’s all-important 18A process, which was supposed to mark the company’s return to silicon process leadership, is still going into “volume production” in the second half of 2025, but don’t expect a full complement of laptops built on Intel’s Panther Lake silicon at once. Intel says it’ll launch its first Panther Lake chip for power users by the end of the year, but additional chips will come in Q1, according to Intel Products chief Michelle Johnston Holthaus.\nSome of Intel’s chips may also cost more due to tariffs, though, and Intel’s bracing for people to potentially buy fewer computers as a result. “While we have offsets, including a global, highly diversified manufacturing footprint to help mitigate tariffs, we will certainly see costs increase and we feel it prudent to anticipate a TAM contraction,” Intel CFO David Zinsner says on the call.\nThat said, Holthaus says Panther Lake should be a good product from both performance and price perspectives, unlike the too-expensive Lunar Lake. She confirmed that the future Nova Lake, like Panther Lake, won’t be built entirely on Intel’s wafers but will still lean on Taiwan’s TSMC as well, but the plan is to eventually get to 70 percent manufactured in-house. Zinsner says Intel now believes it’s prudent to always have some outside manufacturing in addition to Intel’s own.\nHere’s the full memo for posterity:\nThe following note from Lip-Bu Tan was emailed to all Intel Corporation employees on April 24, 2025:\nTeam,\nToday we reported our Q1 2025 results. It was a step in the right direction as we delivered revenue, gross margin and EPS (earnings per share) above our guidance, driven by Dave and Michelle’s leadership. I want to thank them both, and all of you, for the good execution.\nWe need to build on this progress — and it won’t be easy. We are navigating an increasingly volatile and uncertain macroeconomic environment, which is reflected in our Q2 outlook. On top of that, there are many areas where we must improve. We need to confront our challenges head-on and take swift actions to get back on track.\nAs I have said, this starts by revamping our culture. The feedback I have received from our customers and many of you has been consistent. We are seen as too slow, too complex and too set in our ways — and we need to change.\nOur flatter Executive Team (ET) structure that I shared last week was a first step. The next step is to drive greater simplicity, speed and collaboration across the entire company. To achieve these objectives, today I am announcing some important changes.\nBecoming an Engineering-Focused Company\nWe need to get back to our roots and empower our engineers. That’s why I elevated our core engineering functions to the ET. And many of the changes we will be driving are designed to make engineers more productive by removing burdensome workflows and processes that slow down the pace of innovation.\nTo make necessary investments in our engineering talent and technology roadmaps, we need to find new ways to reduce our costs. While we have taken significant actions in the last year, our current cost structure is still well above competitive benchmarks. With that in mind, we have reduced our operating expense and capital spending targets going forward, which I will discuss during our investor call this afternoon.\nFlattening the Organization\nAs we refocus on engineering, we will also remove organizational complexity. Many teams are eight or more layers deep, which creates unnecessary bureaucracy that slows us down. I have asked the ET to take a fresh look at their respective orgs, with a focus on removing layers, increasing spans of control and empowering top performers. Our competitors are lean, fast and agile — and that’s what we must become to improve our execution.\nI’ve been surprised to learn that, in recent years, the most important KPI for many managers at Intel has been the size of their teams. Going forward, this will not be the case. I’m a big believer in the philosophy that the best leaders get the most done with the fewest people. We will embrace this mindset across the company, which will include empowering our top talent to make decisions and take greater ownership of key priorities.\nThere is no way around the fact that these critical changes will reduce the size of our workforce. As I said when I joined, we need to make some very hard decisions to put our company on a solid footing for the future. This will begin in Q2 and we will move as quickly as possible over the next several months.\nWe are going to be very intentional about where we focus these efforts and how we stack up against the best in the industry. We have learned some valuable lessons from past actions. We must balance our reductions with the need to retain and recruit key talent. I will empower each of my leaders to make the best possible decisions aligned with our top priorities. These decisions will not be made lightly, and we will keep you regularly informed.\nStreamlining Our Processes\nIt has been eye-opening for me to see how much time and energy is spent on internal administrative work that does not move our business forward. We need to radically simplify this to maximize the time spent focusing on our customers.\nI am instructing our leaders to eliminate unnecessary meetings and significantly reduce the number of meeting attendees. Too much valuable time is being wasted. We will also modernize processes with a focus on live dashboards and better data to ensure we have the real-time insights we need to make better and faster decisions.\nIn addition, I have decided to make our formal Insights and OKR requirements optional. While it’s crucial for us to stay accountable for our results and receive feedback on our performance, I believe we can achieve this in a simpler and more flexible way. Along the same lines, we will cut back on time-consuming corporate administrative tasks such as non-essential training and documentation.\nReturning to the Office\nOur existing policy is that our hybrid employees should spend approximately three days per week on site. Adherence to this policy has been uneven at best. I strongly believe that our sites need to be vibrant hubs of collaboration that reflect our culture in action.\nWhen we spend time together in person, it fosters more engaging and productive discussion and debate. It drives better and faster decision-making. And it strengthens our connection with colleagues.\nWith that in mind, we will be updating our policy to require four days per week on site by Sept. 1. I wanted to tell you well in advance so that you have time to make any adjustments to your daily routines. We are going to work hard in the meantime to ensure sites are ready to operate at full capacity. Your local leadership will share site-specific details and seek your input on how to create the best possible on-site experience.\nBuilding a New Intel\nI realize this is a lot to take in, but we are playing from behind and we need to rally as a team to put ourselves in the best possible position to win.\nThis requires us to be laser-focused on developing the best products. We need to delight our customers and earn their trust by delivering the performance, quality and reliability they need to succeed. We must demonstrate predictable execution and ensure on-time delivery. And we need to deliver consistent returns for our shareholders.\nThere are two ways teams can respond at make-or-break moments like this: They can look at the gap they need to close and give up — or they can look inside themselves and fight like never before.\nI made my choice last month when I decided to join you all, and there is no place I would rather be right now. I came on board knowing full well this would be the most challenging job of my career, but also the most motivating and fulfilling — because we have opportunities ahead that most people don’t get in their careers.\nI’m talking about the opportunity to fundamentally reinvent an industry icon. To pull off a comeback that will be studied in business schools for generations to come. To create new technologies and deploy them at scale to change the world for the better.\nIntel was once widely seen as the world’s most innovative company. There’s no reason we can’t get back there, so long as we drive the changes needed to improve.\nIt’s going to be hard. It will require painful decisions. But we will make them knowing it’s what we must do to serve our customers better as we build a new Intel for the future – and I have great confidence in the power of our team and our people to make it happen.\nThank you for everything you did in Q1. I look forward to talking more tomorrow during our All Company Meeting.\nLip-Bu Tan",

        "scrap_content": "Will Elon Musk really leave Doge and what happens when he does?\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has said he will step back from his role with the Trump administration's cost-cutting team known as Doge.\nThose at the White House, including the president, have said it has long been the plan that Musk would soon step away, but the news came as the billionaire's car business saw earnings plunge.\nMusk's announcement left many unanswered questions, including when he will actually leave the administration and what will happen to Doge, which stands for Department of Government Efficiency.\nPresident Donald Trump reinforced the message, telling the BBC on Wednesday that the administration was preparing for Musk's departure.\n\"We have to, at some point, let him go and do that. We expected to be doing it about this time. I'll talk to Elon about it,\" Trump said at the White House.\nThe president also said Tesla will \"be taken care of\" once Musk returns and alleged that Musk was being \"treated very unfairly, I guess, by some of the public\".\n\"He's a great patriot, and [that] should have never happened to him,\" Trump added.\nHowever, under government rules, spending fewer days at Doge could actually prolong Musk's stint in government.\nMusk has been designated a \"special government employee\" (SGE) – a label that allows him to work at a paid or unpaid government job for 130 days each year.\nAccording to a 2007 Department of Justice memo, cited in an October 2024 guidance document from the Office of Government Ethics, any day on which an SGE performs any work for the government counts as a full day towards that limit.\nMeasured from Trump's inauguration on 20 January, the 130-day limit - assuming Musk, who brags about working weekends, clocks roughly five days a week at Doge - would run out toward the end of May.\nBut scaling back would extend that timeframe. Additionally, the 130-day limit would reset in January 2026.\nMusk has not given details on his intended schedule. He made the announcement on Tuesday, after Tesla reported financial troubles including a 71% drop in profits.\nThe drop came after repeated \"Tesla takedown\" protests across the globe and calls for boycotts against the car manufacturer amid Musk's government role. While organisers have said most protests have been peaceful, some have been destructive with fires set at Tesla showrooms or at charging stations.\n- Musk's Tesla facilities in US face 'Takedown' protests\n- Trump says anti-Tesla protesters will face 'hell'\n- Musk to reduce Doge role after Tesla profits plunge\nThe company warned investors that the pain could continue, declining to offer a growth forecast while saying \"changing political sentiment\" could meaningfully hurt demand for the vehicles.\nMusk told investors on an earnings call that the time he allocates to Doge \"will drop significantly\" and that he would be \"allocating far more of my time to Tesla\".\nAfter the comments, Tesla's languishing stock price rose.\nIt's also unclear how many days Musk has already worked for the government, whether the government is keeping a tally, and how the limit would be enforced.\nThere has been criticism that the Trump administration may have flouted government rules in creating Musk's unprecedented role, and concerns that he may not follow the time limit.\nUnder rules for SGEs, Musk would have to undergo ethics training, provide a confidential financial disclosure statement, and avoid conflicts of interest.\nHis corporate empire includes large companies that do business with the US government and foreign governments, including SpaceX, which has $22 billion in US government contracts, according to the company's chief executive.\nThe rules also prohibit special government employees from partisan activities, including wearing clothing with political slogans, while in government offices or carrying out official duties. Musk has been pictured wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" hat in the Oval Office.\nStill, in February, an anonymous White House official told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that Musk would file a confidential financial disclosure at some point, and had been given an ethics briefing.\nThe following month, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told the BBC: \"Elon Musk is selflessly serving President Trump's administration as a special government employee, and he has abided by all applicable federal laws.\"\nFor now, Musk appears to serve at Trump's behest, with no clear oversight other than the president himself.\nIn a report released last week, progressive think-tank Public Citizen criticised the Trump administration and said the White House was \"wildly abusing\" the SGE rules.\n\"Right now, the public has no way to know whether SGEs like Musk who don't file public financial disclosure reports or are permitted to oversee themselves are putting the people's interests ahead of their own,\" said report author Jon Golinger.\nThe BBC has contacted Musk and the Office of Personnel Management - the agency overseeing special government employees, and one where Doge employees have reportedly taken over several functions - for comment.\nOn Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported that around 100 Doge employees would remain in various government departments after Musk departs this year.\nMusk and Trump set a deadline for Doge to finish its work, which corresponds to the 250th anniversary of the signing of the US Declaration of Independence.\nThe executive order setting up Doge, signed by Trump on Inauguration Day in January, mentioned 4 July 2026 as the ending date.\nEarlier, in December, Musk responded to a tweet that also said Doge would finish entirely on that date.\n\"The final step of DOGE is to delete itself,\" he wrote.",

        "scrap_content": "Intel has given a weak forecast for the current period and said it is cutting workers to bring costs in line with the business’s smaller size.\nSecond-quarter revenue will be between $11.2 billion and $12.4 billion, the company said in a statement Thursday.\nThat compares with an average of analysts’ estimates of $12.9 billion.\nIntel shares were down 6.4 per cent in extended trading.\nThe results come a day after it emerged the company was set to announce plans to cut more than 20 per cent of its workforce, prompting concern at its plant in Leixlip, Co Kildare where almost 5,000 people are employed.\nWhile specifics were lacking, Minister for Enterprise Peter Burke said Ireland continued to play an important role as the company’s European hub for manufacturing semiconductors, “and we don’t see speculation around headcount reduction changing this”.\nBoth he and IDA Ireland, the foreign direct investment agency, were engaging with he company ahead of its financial results announcement.\nThe cost-cutting plan will involve “eliminating management layers” to enable it to make faster decisions, Intel said. The company does not yet have an estimate for the one-time expenses associated with the cuts, but expects operating costs to be reduced to about $17 billion this year and $16 billion in 2026.\nIts earnings report is the first under the leadership of Lip-Bu Tan, a chip industry veteran who took the job last month. The board hired him after predecessor Pat Gelsinger struggled to restore the competitiveness of Intel’s products. He was ousted late last year after sliding sales and mounting red ink doomed his comeback bid.\nFirst-quarter sales came in at $12.7 billion, topping predictions. The chipmaker follows Texas Instruments Inc. in delivering stronger results than analysts had projected. But its weak forecast suggests that the uptick in demand was just a blip – driven at least in part by a rush of orders ahead of looming tariffs being threatened by the US, China and others.\n“The current macro environment is creating elevated uncertainty across the industry, which is reflected in our outlook,” Intel chief financial officer David Zinsner said in the statement. “We are taking a disciplined and prudent approach to support continued investment in our core products and foundry businesses while maximising operational cost savings and capital efficiency.”\nMr Zinsner said he does not currently have an estimate for the size of the workforce reduction.\nThursday’s conference call will be the first time Mr Tan has faced questions from Wall Street on how he plans to resurrect the company’s fortunes, something he has said “won’t happen overnight.”\nMr Gelsinger had concentrated on Intel’s factory network, once its most powerful asset. He laid out plans to spend tens of billions of dollars on giving the company the world’s best production technology again, and luring rivals into using it as outsourced provider of manufacturing.\n“The first quarter was a step in the right direction, but there are no quick fixes as we work to get back on a path to gaining market share and driving sustainable growth,” Mr Tan said in the statement.\n“I am taking swift actions to drive better execution and operational efficiency while empowering our engineers to create great products. We are going back to basics by listening to our customers and making the changes needed to build the new Intel.” – Bloomberg",
